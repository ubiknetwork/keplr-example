# Configuration

See comments on `src/main.js`.
You should probably update the IP and the chain-id.

## Project dependencies

We need to install a few packages before setting it up.
On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install make g++ pkg-config
sudo apt install libusb-dev libudev-dev
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

## Project setup

After cloning `cd` into that folder:

```bash
cd keplr-example
npm install
```

### Project run

```bash
npm run dev
```
